Discussed Ideas in discord call at 3pm about how we should go forward with the challenge code
Ideas include:
-store the red value of the line 
-work out the line thickness and how it corrresponds with the camera view (how many pixels are shown in the camera view)
-the robot must always have the red values on the left hand side of the camera view for it to go forward, 
if the red pixels slowly go away, like in the maze get it to turn right.
