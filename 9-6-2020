Today we had our group call on discord. Over the past couple of days we all had a crack at starting core so we would show up to the meeting with ideas. Liam had an almost working core code. Alex, Maddie, and Liv worked on the finding white pixels part of the core and Liam got the rest of his working. We tried to start completion and brainstormed ideas but didnâ€™t get far. We are going to have another call on Thursday to sort out completion.
