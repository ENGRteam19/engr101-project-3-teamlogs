Today we had our first group call on discord that lasted about an hour. We did our plan for the project, assigned rolls (though decided we wanted to mainly all help each other with the actual coding), and discussed how we are going to achieve this. We all wanted to get to at least attempting challenge for our end aim. Between Thursday and the weekend, we are going to individually see how we would tackle the core part and discuss our ideas in discord. Our next call is planned for Tues 9th June.
